# Reproductions

Hey there!

When it comes to fixing bugs, having a minimal reproduction is like having a treasure map â€” it
guides us directly to the issue's source, making the debugging process much smoother and
more efficient. Think of it as giving us the perfect starting point to tackle the bug head-on!

A minimal reproduction is the smallest, simplest example that shows the problem you're
encountering. It contains only the necessary components to demonstrate the issue without any
extra complexity. Think of it as stripping away everything that's not directly related to the
problem, so we can focus solely on understanding and fixing it.

> How can I create a reproduction?

1. Head over to our [examples repository][vds-examples] and find the example that would be the best
   starting point. For example, if you're using the Default Layout with React then you could use
   the [`player/react/default-layout`][react-layout-example].

2. Click the big blue button in the README that says "Open in StackBlitz" to open the project in
   a remote coding environment.

3. Setup the project to demonstrate your issue and leave any instructions in the README
   or via code comments. Please include the media and provider you're experiencing the
   issue with.

4. When you're done you can send us the link to the StackBlitz project by copying the URL in your
   browser search bar or clicking the "Share" button in the top left toolbar.
