# Contributing

First off, thank you for taking the time to contribute to Vidstack ‚ù§Ô∏è

## üéí Getting Started

### Installation

Let's setup our machine. The only software you'll need to install is:

- [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)
- [volta](https://docs.volta.sh/guide) or [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (we recommend volta)

They're very easy to install, just follow the links and you should be up and running in no time.

### Fork & Clone

Next, head over to the [Vidstack repository on GitHub][vidstack-gh] and click the `Fork` button
in the top right corner. After the project has been forked, run the following commands in your
terminal...

```bash
$: git clone https://github.com/{your-github-username}/vidstack --depth=1

$: cd vidstack
```

**OPTIONAL:** Now it'll help if we keep our `main` branch pointing at the original repository and
make pull requests from the forked branch.

```bash
# Add the original repository as a "remote" called "upstream".
$: git remote add upstream git@github.com:vidstack/player.git

# Fetch the git information from the remote.
$: git fetch upstream

# Set your local main branch to use the upstream main branch when ever you run `git pull`.
$: git branch --set-upstream-to=upstream/main main

# Run this when we want to update our version of main.
$: git pull upstream --rebase
```

### Node

Set your Node version to match the required version by the repo. If you've installed `volta` then
it will automatically pin it, and if you're using `nvm` simply run `nvm use` from the project root.

## üíº Package Manager

```bash
# Install all dependencies and symlink packages in the workspace (see `pnpm-workspace.yaml`).
$: pnpm i

# Install dependency for a single package.
$: pnpm -F vidstack install {package}

# Update a dependency for a single package.
$: pnpm -F react up {package}

# Update a dependency for all packages.
$: pnpm up {package}@{version} -r
```

## üèó Building

```bash
# Build all packages (turbo)
$: pnpm build

# Build single package (turbo)
$: pnpm build:vidstack
$: pnpm build:react

# Build and watch single package.
$: pnpm -F vidstack dev
$: pnpm -F @vidstack/react dev
```

### Sandbox

A sandbox is a Vite development environment that enables you to play with a package right in your
browser. The sandbox directory is Git-ignored so you can safely do whatever you like inside of
it.

```bash
# Play with package in your browser.
$: pnpm -F vidstack sandbox
$: pnpm -F @vidstack/react sandbox
```

After running any of the commands above, you can find the sandbox directory at `packages/*/sandbox`.
You can delete the directory and re-run the sandbox command to reset it.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Committing

This project uses [semantic commit messages][semantic-commit-style] to automate package releases.
Refer to the link, and check out existing commits (`git log`) to get an idea of how to write
your message.

## üéâ Pull Requests

When you're all done, head over to the [repository][vidstack-gh] and click the big green
`Compare & Pull Request` button. This will appear after you've pushed changes to your fork.

Don't expect your PR to be accepted immediately, or accepted at all. Give the community time to
vet it and see if it should be merged. Please don't be disheartened if it's not accepted. Your
contribution is appreciated more then you can imagine, and even a failed PR can teach us a lot ‚ù§Ô∏è
